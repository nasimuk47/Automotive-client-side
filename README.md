-   ### User Authentication:

-   ### Product Management:

    Create a feature for users to add, update, and delete products. You can create a dashboard where authenticated users can manage their product listings. Implement role-based access control to differentiate between regular users and admin users.

-   ### Reviews and Ratings:
    Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for products. Display average ratings and reviews on the product detail pages. You can also consider implementing a comment system for discussions.
